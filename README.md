## Introduction

Car Counting Project aims to provide an efficient solution for counting cars in a video stream using state-of-the-art object detection techniques. It leverages the power of YOLOv5 and OpenCV to achieve high accuracy and performance.

## Features

- Real-time car detection and counting
- Easy to use and modify
- High accuracy with YOLOv5
- Detailed logging and visualization

## Installation

To get started with the Car Counting Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Car-Counting-Project.git
    cd Car-Counting-Project
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the script with the following command:
```sh
python main.py
```

### Example Command

```sh
python main.py --video path/to/your/video.mp4 --output path/to/save/output.mp4
```

### Command-line Arguments

- `--video`: Path to the input video file.
- `--output`: Path to save the output video file with detected cars and counting.
